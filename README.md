- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Sebby
- Iâ€™m interested in UX/UI design and gaming development.
- I currently am a senior in a bachelors for Fine Arts with a concentration in animation.
    -My skills focus in the adobe suite, 2d/3d animation but i am working on being a more rounded artist in the field of programming as i am working on developing my own visual novel. I have a background with python, html, and css as well.
